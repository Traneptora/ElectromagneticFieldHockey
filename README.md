Electromagnetic Field Hockey
============================

Electromagnetic Field Hockey is based of "Electric Field Hockey" on phet.colorado.edu, but with magnetism programmed in.

Note that the magnetic field effects are orders of magnitude smaller than electric field effects,
so this uses large magnetic fields to make the effects visisble.
